# HANDOFF — grid-first path network (the path rework Jim actually asked for)

Branch `feat/grid-paths`, stacked on `feat/park-warp-solver` (#474).
Worktree `.claude/worktrees/park-warp/.claude/worktrees/grid-paths`.
**pnpm**, not npm. Dev port 5611 if needed.

## Jim's brief, verbatim (2 Sep, direct — THE authority; re-read, do not paraphrase)

1. "the player can stand in 'path mess' near the first bridge on the main
   branch" (screenshot: apron knot of overlapping ribbon at the bridge foot).
2. "paths get plotted, then bridges added, but I fundamentally think this
   is the wrong approach ... it souldn't be make paths and then put bridges
   on after the fact, these need to be consdiered together from the start."
3. "they should be on an aproximate grid layout but they end up with twists
   and mini-turns etc that make no sense visually."
4. "the paths don't go up to the door of the hotel or up to the castle
   door, or other attractions reliably."
5. END GOAL: "a park that makes paths that actually go to useful places,
   zero level crossings (the ability to create LC should not even exist)
   and that looks good with things roughly evenly spaced around."
6. "A big-bang rewrite is fine if it fixes the many issues with path
   plotting we currently have."
7. After #474 preview: "I don't understand how this fixes the issues I
   reported ... The path still doesn't go up to the hotel for example."
   → the path rework must include EVERYTHING above; do not stop until
   everything he asked for is ready.

Zero-LC is done (parent branch). THIS branch owes 1, 3, 4 and the rest of 2.

## What is built (Stage 1 — done, pushed)

`src/world/paths.ts` no longer plots anything in continuous space. The
street-lattice/stubs/spurs/`fallbackSpurRoute`/`routeLeg` stack is **deleted**
(with it: `sameSideLeg`, `doubleCrossingLeg`, `fenceFollowRoute`,
`enforceRailSide`, `manhattanRoute`, `clampPoint`, `polylineCrossesRail`,
`longestOffAxisRun`, `bestBranchPoint`, `nearestPointOnRoute`,
`distanceToRouteNetwork`, `planStreet*`, `snapRunsToLattice`,
`carriesAnOffLatticeStreetRun`, `streetRoute`, `debugStreetSegment`). All 11
required exports are intact; `debugStreetLattice` and `pointStandsOnABridgeRamp`
are kept (the latter's "two measured dead ends" comment is updated in place, not
lost — this ticket IS the "own ticket" it names).

**One graph** (`pathGridSearch`, a generator drained by `pathGrid()`):

- the existing 12 m lattice (`STREET_PITCH`, unchanged), nodes at intersections
  inside the boundary, minus plots, rail corridor, ring interior, bridge masonry;
- **jog links**: where a straight run between adjacent nodes is blocked, a
  three-segment step round it through half-pitch offsets;
- **mandatory nodes**: the four ring gateways, EVERY bridge foot (`crossingFeet`
  over `CROSSING_SITES`), EVERY destination's door;
- **mandatory edges**: each bridge's foot→deck→foot polyline — the only edge in
  the graph that crosses the railway;
- **terminal connectors** per door (`gridConnectors`), straight or elbowed via
  the node's own street line, preferring a head-on arrival along the doormat's
  outward ray.

Selection: `routeFromNetwork(goal)` = Dijkstra from everything already paved to
the door node; the ring is paved from the outset. `ensureCompassTaps` and
`addInterconnects` are grid-routed. `gateApproachSearch` keeps the authored
corridor + retrace scoring but its only solver is the grid.

Rescue path for a district the shared grid cannot reach: get onto the door's own
rail side on the shared grid (over a bridge), then `relayPolyline` — an
axis-aligned walk over the grid's lines and the endpoints' own rows/columns, at
**half pitch**, screened with the door's arrival exemption. It carries the rail
side screen, so it cannot cross the railway anywhere but a bridge. Backtracks
over 6 bridgeheads × 2 plot clearances (2.6, 2.2).

`strandedDoorsOfLastSolve()` publishes any door that still fell to the
straight-line last resort.

### Findings worth keeping

- Making the **arrival lead** the grid node loses doors outright (seed 131's
  hotel: clean 7.1 m run to the door, no route at all to the point 3.5 m in
  front of it). The door is the node; head-on is a preference in the connector.
- A plot the door stands **inside** must be exempt outright — the slide's chute
  lands inside the castle's plot; `exit-ginormousSlide` had no grid route on 5
  of 16 seeds because of it.
- **Forbidding** a route to pass through a door node cuts the park up: a door's
  own 2-3 connectors can be the only join between lattice islands (seed 5's ring
  could reach 28 nodes). Priced at `DOOR_THROUGH_PENALTY` instead.
- The goal must be excluded from its own search's sources, or a door another
  route already paved through gets a one-point route and `CatmullRomCurve3`
  throws (seeds 5, 11 crashed the park build).
- An arriving leg keeps 2.0 m from the boundary, not a crossroads' 2.6 —
  seeds 225/267 put the rail-race exit 2.38/2.31 m in from the spline.

## State — what remains

- [x] Stage 1 grid solve (pushed).
- [ ] **Stage 2: invariants. NOT STARTED.** `streetsShareLatticeLines` must be
      rewritten for the new grid (it must admit half-pitch runs from jogs and
      the rescue router, and must be at least as strong); add "every doormat is
      a paving terminal", "inside a bridge footprint only the deck edge and its
      two feet", plus the turn-sharpness clause if not implied by
      `pathsRunOnGridAxes`. Each proved red by mutation, red output in the
      commit message, mutation reverted. CLAUDE.md requires this in the same PR.
- [ ] **Stage 3: park-wide measurement.** `pnpm run test:procgen` has NOT been
      run yet. Per-seed `check:park` results: see the table below.
- [ ] Warp re-search (`scripts/warp-search.mts`) for any seed that goes red
      under the new plotter; prefer emptying a vector where the seed passes
      unwarped.
- [ ] Delete the temporary debug exports and scripts before the PR:
      `debugRelaxedDoors`, `debugDoorReach`, `debugGridReach` at the end of
      `paths.ts`, and `scripts/tmp-*.mts`. `strandedDoorsOfLastSolve` is meant
      to stay (the invariants should read it).
- [ ] No PR yet, by instruction.

### check:park, pool seeds (see /tmp/gp/results.txt for the live run)

Last measured by hand: seed 5 PASS (19/19, 0 crossings, 1 recorded deviation),
seed 128 PASS, seed 11 FAIL (a ribbon still crosses the rail off-site — 3 doors
stranded: building, ballPit, exit-ginormousSlide), seed 131 FAIL
(`poi.stranded: 6`, all six on the gate corridor at x=0, z 32..52 — the
corridor is drawn and reaches the ring rim, so this is the poiGraph pocket, not
a missing route; not yet diagnosed).

### The two open shapes of failure

1. **Stranded doors** (seed 11): the district is cut off on its own rail side
   and `relayPolyline` cannot thread it either. The old code reached these with
   `fenceFollowRoute` — hugging the rail fence round the loop, which is exactly
   the "twists and mini-turns" Jim rejected. If a grid answer cannot be found,
   the honest options are a seed swap (Jim's 2 Sep sixteen-good-seeds ruling) or
   a warp vector, not a diagonal.
2. **poi.stranded on the gate corridor** (seed 131): diagnose from
   `check:park`'s own output; the corridor's ribbon is drawn and connected, so
   suspect the wall runs (`Scenery.ts` owns wall-vs-path) or paving coverage
   round the corridor's seam.

## Open elsewhere

- #474 blocks on Jim's canonical ruling (widen vs leave pool) — separate.
- Visual QA owed on both PRs; Overseer dispatches.
