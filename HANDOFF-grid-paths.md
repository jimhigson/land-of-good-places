# HANDOFF — grid-first path network (the path rework Jim actually asked for)

Branch `feat/grid-paths`, stacked on `feat/park-warp-solver` (#474).
Worktree `.claude/worktrees/park-warp/.claude/worktrees/grid-paths`.
**pnpm**, not npm. Dev port 5611 if needed.

## Jim's brief, verbatim (2 Sep, direct — THE authority; re-read, do not paraphrase)

1. "the player can stand in 'path mess' near the first bridge on the main
   branch" (screenshot: apron knot of overlapping ribbon at the bridge foot).
2. "paths get plotted, then bridges added, but I fundamentally think this
   is the wrong approach ... it souldn't be make paths and then put bridges
   on after the fact, these need to be consdiered together from the start."
3. "they should be on an aproximate grid layout but they end up with twists
   and mini-turns etc that make no sense visually."
4. "the paths don't go up to the door of the hotel or up to the castle
   door, or other attractions reliably."
5. END GOAL: "a park that makes paths that actually go to useful places,
   zero level crossings (the ability to create LC should not even exist)
   and that looks good with things roughly evenly spaced around."
6. "A big-bang rewrite is fine if it fixes the many issues with path
   plotting we currently have."
7. After #474 preview: "I don't understand how this fixes the issues I
   reported ... The path still doesn't go up to the hotel for example."
   → the path rework must include EVERYTHING above; do not stop until
   everything he asked for is ready.

Zero-LC is done (parent branch). THIS branch owes 1, 3, 4 and the rest of 2.

## What is built (Stage 1 — done, pushed)

`src/world/paths.ts` no longer plots anything in continuous space. The
street-lattice/stubs/spurs/`fallbackSpurRoute`/`routeLeg` stack is **deleted**
(with it: `sameSideLeg`, `doubleCrossingLeg`, `fenceFollowRoute`,
`enforceRailSide`, `manhattanRoute`, `clampPoint`, `polylineCrossesRail`,
`longestOffAxisRun`, `bestBranchPoint`, `nearestPointOnRoute`,
`distanceToRouteNetwork`, `planStreet*`, `snapRunsToLattice`,
`carriesAnOffLatticeStreetRun`, `streetRoute`, `debugStreetSegment`). All 11
required exports are intact; `debugStreetLattice` and `pointStandsOnABridgeRamp`
are kept (the latter's "two measured dead ends" comment is updated in place, not
lost — this ticket IS the "own ticket" it names).

**One graph** (`pathGridSearch`, a generator drained by `pathGrid()`):

- the existing 12 m lattice (`STREET_PITCH`, unchanged), nodes at intersections
  inside the boundary, minus plots, rail corridor, ring interior, bridge masonry;
- **jog links**: where a straight run between adjacent nodes is blocked, a
  three-segment step round it through half-pitch offsets;
- **mandatory nodes**: the four ring gateways, EVERY bridge foot (`crossingFeet`
  over `CROSSING_SITES`), EVERY destination's door;
- **mandatory edges**: each bridge's foot→deck→foot polyline — the only edge in
  the graph that crosses the railway;
- **terminal connectors** per door (`gridConnectors`), straight or elbowed via
  the node's own street line, preferring a head-on arrival along the doormat's
  outward ray.

Selection: `routeFromNetwork(goal)` = Dijkstra from everything already paved to
the door node; the ring is paved from the outset. `ensureCompassTaps` and
`addInterconnects` are grid-routed. `gateApproachSearch` keeps the authored
corridor + retrace scoring but its only solver is the grid.

Rescue path for a district the shared grid cannot reach: get onto the door's own
rail side on the shared grid (over a bridge), then `relayPolyline` — an
axis-aligned walk over the grid's lines and the endpoints' own rows/columns, at
**half pitch**, screened with the door's arrival exemption. It carries the rail
side screen, so it cannot cross the railway anywhere but a bridge. Backtracks
over 6 bridgeheads × 2 plot clearances (2.6, 2.2).

`strandedDoorsOfLastSolve()` publishes any door that still fell to the
straight-line last resort.

### Findings worth keeping

- Making the **arrival lead** the grid node loses doors outright (seed 131's
  hotel: clean 7.1 m run to the door, no route at all to the point 3.5 m in
  front of it). The door is the node; head-on is a preference in the connector.
- A plot the door stands **inside** must be exempt outright — the slide's chute
  lands inside the castle's plot; `exit-ginormousSlide` had no grid route on 5
  of 16 seeds because of it.
- **Forbidding** a route to pass through a door node cuts the park up: a door's
  own 2-3 connectors can be the only join between lattice islands (seed 5's ring
  could reach 28 nodes). Priced at `DOOR_THROUGH_PENALTY` instead.
- The goal must be excluded from its own search's sources, or a door another
  route already paved through gets a one-point route and `CatmullRomCurve3`
  throws (seeds 5, 11 crashed the park build).
- An arriving leg keeps 2.0 m from the boundary, not a crossroads' 2.6 —
  seeds 225/267 put the rail-race exit 2.38/2.31 m in from the spline.

## State — what remains

- [x] Stage 1 grid solve (pushed).
- [ ] **Stage 2: invariants. NOT STARTED.** `streetsShareLatticeLines` must be
      rewritten for the new grid (it must admit half-pitch runs from jogs and
      the rescue router, and must be at least as strong); add "every doormat is
      a paving terminal", "inside a bridge footprint only the deck edge and its
      two feet", plus the turn-sharpness clause if not implied by
      `pathsRunOnGridAxes`. Each proved red by mutation, red output in the
      commit message, mutation reverted. CLAUDE.md requires this in the same PR.
- [ ] **Stage 3: park-wide measurement.** GREEN: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
      (exit 0), `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.test.json` (exit 0),
      `pnpm run build` (exit 0). RED: `pnpm run test:procgen` and the per-seed
      `check:park` sweep — results below. `pnpm run check` (the 47-step chain)
      has NOT been run.
- [ ] Warp re-search (`scripts/warp-search.mts`) for any seed that goes red
      under the new plotter; prefer emptying a vector where the seed passes
      unwarped.
- [ ] Delete the temporary debug exports and scripts before the PR:
      `debugRelaxedDoors`, `debugDoorReach`, `debugGridReach` at the end of
      `paths.ts`, and `scripts/tmp-*.mts`. `strandedDoorsOfLastSolve` is meant
      to stay (the invariants should read it).
- [ ] No PR yet, by instruction.

### check:park, all 15 measured pool seeds (2 Sep, at `the last resort may not hop the railway`)

`LGP_SEED=<s> node --no-warnings --import ./scripts/ts-extension-resolver-register.mjs scripts/check-park.mts`

| seed | exit | note | doors stranded |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 0 | 19/19, 0 crossings, 293/293 waypoints, 1 recorded deviation | — |
| 11 | 1 | 2 invariant regressions | building, ballPit, exit-ginormousSlide |
| 24 | 1 | poi.stranded | station-0 |
| 115 | 1 | poi.stranded 16 | stall.spaceFerrisWheel |
| 128 | 0 | 19/19, 220/220 | — |
| 131 | 1 | poi.stranded 6 | — |
| 208 | 0 | 19/19, 216/216 | — |
| 225 | 1 | poi.stranded 105 (114/219 seeds in the main component) | — |
| 267 | 0 | 19/19, 256/256 | — |
| 274 | 0 | 19/19, 222/222 | — |

| 428 | 0 | 19/19, 191/191 | — |
| 451 | 1 | poi.stranded 3 | — |

Plus the canonical seed (no `LGP_SEED`): exit 1, `poi.stranded: 41`, no doors
stranded. It was a hard build failure until `the gate approach's own fallback
may not hop the railway either`.

**8 pass, 8 fail (incl. canonical). Every failure is `poi.stranded`** — no seed
fails on reachability, on an illegal rail crossing, or on any other check:park
invariant. That is one defect class, not eight.

### test:procgen (at `the last resort may not hop the railway`)

`Test Files 3 failed | 14 passed (17)`, `Tests 1 failed | 497 passed | 81
skipped (579)`, exit 1. The three failed *files* are two whole-file failures
(`scatterDecoupling.test.ts`, `seed-canonical.test.ts` — both from the
canonical build throwing at the time, since fixed) plus the one failed *test*:

```
FAIL test/procgen/seed-11.test.ts > seed 11 > every street sits on the shared 12 m lattice
  spur-waterFight runs north-south for 10.0 m on x = 39.23, 6.00 m off the nearest 12 m lattice line
  spur-stall.skyCruiser runs north-south for 15.4 m on x = -32.77, 6.00 m off
  spur-exit-skyCruiser runs north-south for 30.0 m on x = -60.90, 1.87 m off
```

This is exactly the invariant Stage 2 must rewrite, and the numbers say how:
the two **6.00 m** offenders are half-pitch runs from the jog/relay routers —
the same grid one level finer, which the successor invariant should admit by
name. The **1.87 m** one is a genuine violation (a run on a door's own private
line) and the successor must still catch it. Rewriting it to allow half-pitch
and nothing else is therefore *stronger* than the current test on that third
run and honest about the first two — do not simply widen the tolerance.

### The two open shapes of failure

1. **`poi.stranded`, the whole remaining failure set.** Seed 225 is the loud
   one: 114 of 219 waypoint seeds in the main component, i.e. the poiGraph is
   cut roughly in half. Seed 131's six are all on the gate corridor at `x = 0`,
   `z = 32..52`, which *is* drawn and *does* reach the ring rim — so it is not
   a missing route. **Measured and ruled out**: the rescue router's relaxed
   plot clearance. Forcing its ladder back to `STREET_PLOT_CLEARANCE` alone
   leaves seeds 326/451/225 at exactly 1 / 3 / 105 stranded — identical. The
   next hypothesis to test is the *waypoint graph across a bridge*: on this
   branch only the routes that need to cross do so, where the old plotter sent
   several, and `poiGraph`'s own walkability link may not survive a ramp.
   Compare `poiGraph: N/M seeds placed, K in the main component` on the parent
   branch for the same seed before assuming this branch caused it.
2. **Stranded doors** (seeds 11, 24, 115): the district is cut off on its own
   rail side and `relayPolyline` cannot thread it either. The old code reached
   these with `fenceFollowRoute` — hugging the rail fence round the loop, which
   is exactly the "twists and mini-turns" Jim rejected. If a grid answer cannot
   be found, the honest options are a seed swap (Jim's 2 Sep sixteen-good-seeds
   ruling) or a warp vector, not a diagonal.

## Open elsewhere

- #474 blocks on Jim's canonical ruling (widen vs leave pool) — separate.
- Visual QA owed on both PRs; Overseer dispatches.
