/**
 * **Does the hotel hold its people up, and stop them walking through the
 * furniture?**
 *
 * ```
 * npm run check:hotel
 * ```
 *
 * Four assertions, one per rule Jim asked for after playing the hotel
 * (7 August 2026), all measured on the **real built park** rather than on the
 * rules that built it:
 *
 * 1. **Nobody falls through the world.** Family QA found all seven hotel
 *    guests at y = −16.4…−16.9 m — the park's raw terrain height out at the
 *    hotel's coordinates — under rooms whose floors are `WalkSurfaces`
 *    platforms at y = 0. The residents were already using the park's own
 *    sampler; what was wrong was where they *asked from*.
 *    `WalkSurfaces.sample(x, z, y)` only offers a platform within a step **up**
 *    of `y`, and `NpcCharacter`'s constructor seeds y from `terrainHeight`, so
 *    a body starting 16 m below its own floor is told, correctly, that it has
 *    none — and falls for ever. Fixed by `NpcCharacter.settle(from)` and
 *    `ResidentSpec.floorY`. This is QA's own suggested regression, widened
 *    from the residents to **every** child in the game, because the next one
 *    of these will be somebody else.
 * 2. **Every prop is solid.** Jim: *"the statues and chairs you can clip
 *    through are weird."* One footprint per prop, registered by
 *    `world/hotel/place.ts`, feeds both `CollisionWorld` and the guest
 *    keep-outs — so this asks the collision world, which is the consumer that
 *    a child actually meets.
 * 3. **…except the beds.** They are platforms you stand on, and a wall round
 *    the edge of one would shove a jumping child back off it. Asserted
 *    explicitly rather than left as an absence, because "we forgot the beds"
 *    and "the beds are deliberately soft" look identical from outside.
 * 4. **Every declared window is built.** Rooms declare windows in
 *    `layout.ts` and `Hotel.glazeWall` clips them to the wall's solid spans,
 *    so a careless number is silently dropped rather than left floating in a
 *    doorway. Silent is the problem: this counts them.
 *
 * Proven red before it was trusted green: restoring the old settle height
 * fails (1) with all seven residents at −16.5 m; making a chair soft fails
 * (2); making a bed solid fails (3); widening a declared window past its
 * doorway fails (4).
