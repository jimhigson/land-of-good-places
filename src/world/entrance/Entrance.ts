/**
 * The park entrance: a gated arch in the boundary wall, and a little bus stop
 * with a shelter just inside — always present, whether or not the cat bus is
 * mid-arrival. See `Garden.ts`'s `buildBoundaryWall` for the matching gap left
 * in the wall itself, and `paths.ts`'s `spur-entrance` route for the path that
 * leads up to it.
 *
 * **The park's name is no longer painted on a board under the arch.** The
 * family had every sign in the park taken out on 28 July 2026 — a canvas face
 * on a rectangle seen from the camera's one fixed angle is hard to read, which
 * is exactly why it needed a full-screen reader to go with it. The name is not
 * lost: `ui/Hud.ts`'s park pill has said it, in ordinary DOM text at the
 * ordinary minimum size, since long before this. The arch keeps its posts, its
 * caps, its paw prints and its crossbar, which is what makes it a gate.
