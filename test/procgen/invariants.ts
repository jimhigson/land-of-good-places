/**
 * **The invariants themselves. This list is meant to grow.**
 *
 * Adding one is a small function taking {@link ParkFacts} plus one line in
 * {@link INVARIANTS}. It then runs against every seed automatically, because
 * each seed file just calls {@link registerParkInvariants}.
 *
 * Three rules for anything added here:
 *
 * 1. **Measure the built park, never the rules that built it.** `ParkFacts`
 *    reads everything back off a real `World`. An invariant that re-derives a
 *    placement rule and checks the placement agrees with it has proved
 *    nothing — see the header of `parkFacts.ts`.
 * 2. **Thresholds come from the game, not from the generator.** Prefer
 *    `PLAYER_RADIUS`, `TRACK_CLEARANCE`, `SHORTFALL_TOLERANCE` — numbers that
 *    already mean something — over the constant the generator happens to aim
 *    for. Asserting the generator's own target only proves it can do
 *    arithmetic, and it turns every future tuning change into a test failure.
 * 3. **Return your complaints; do not assert them.** {@link Invariant} is
 *    `=> readonly string[]` and {@link registerParkInvariants} does the
 *    asserting. See that type's own comment for why it is not `=> void`:
 *    briefly, a hollow invariant that passed unconditionally shipped into this
 *    suite, and the return type is what makes writing another one a compile
 *    error rather than a thing you have to remember.
 *
 * **Whichever you write, prove it can fail.** Break the thing it guards, watch
 * it go red, put it back. An invariant nobody has ever seen fail is a claim
 * about the park, not a check on it.

 *    round the ring by angle — not by re-running the search and checking it
 *    agrees with itself, but by measuring the real distance between the real

/**
 * **Both Rail Race rings are built outside the park, at their own real size,

 *
 * This is the invariant for the two-ring rebuild of 2 August 2026, and it is
 * really one claim in four parts. All four are measured off the built scene —
 * the rails from their own swept vertices, the legs from their instance
 * matrices, the solidity from the collision world the park actually registered.
 *
 * 1. **Outside the wall, on real ground.** Every rail vertex of every lane of
 *    both rings sits further out than the boundary masonry
 *    (`ENTRANCE_WALL_RADIUS`) by at least `PLAYER_RADIUS` — a child pressed
 *    against the outside of the wall is not standing in a rail — and further in
 *    than the edge of the terrain disc, because a trestle needs ground under it.
 *    The whole point of moving out here was that the apron is empty; this is
 *    what stops a later tweak drifting the ring back over the park or off the
 *    hill.
 *
 * 2. **Two sizes, genuinely built.** The race ring's measured radial width is
 *    the ride's own scale factor times the walk-past ring's, taken as the ratio
 *    of the two routes the world is holding rather than as an invented number.
 *    A single ring drawn twice at different `group.scale` would pass a lane-span
 *    check computed from the rules and fail this one, because this one measures
 *    vertices.
 *
 * 3. **Nothing in the ride carries a scale multiply on its geometry.** Every
 *    object under a ring group, and the ring groups themselves, must be at unit
 *    scale — and so must every cart sitting in the park at rest. This is the
 *    literal bug from Jim's screenshot: a rival's cart group was scaled 2.5x
 *    once at construction and never unscaled, so the ambient riders were
 *    two-and-a-half times life size to anyone who walked or flew past. A park
 *    that has just been built is a park at rest, so at rest is what this asserts.
 *
 * 4. **Only the walk-past ring is solid.** Its trestle legs are registered as
 *    collision circles; the race ring's are not. `CollisionWorld` cannot
 *    un-register a collider, so a race ring that ever registered one would leave
 *    an invisible solid post standing in the park for the rest of the session —
 *    the classic "walked into a rail that is not drawn" bug. Checked by asking
 *    the real collision world what is at each measured leg position.

 * that the hole was cut in the right place, at the right height, wide enough,
 * and clear of the towers at either end of the panel.
 *
 * It is measured twice over, on purpose, and the two are not redundant:
 *
 * - the geometric check says *why* — within one panel, this much masonry left
 *   beside the tower, this wide against a car this wide, both openings sharing
 *   a height because the run through the castle is level;
 * - the swept check says *whether* — four rays along the car's own envelope,
 *   fired at **every mesh under the castle's garden root**, naming what they
 *   hit. It knows nothing about walls or towers, so a fixture added to the
 *   castle later is covered from the day it appears.
 *
 * Both are the same functions the boot assert and `check:castle-window` run,
 * so there is one definition of "does the ride fit" and it cannot drift.
 *
 * **An empty pass is a pass.** Nothing reserves the castle for the coaster: on
 * a seed whose loop goes round it instead, no windows are cut, the castle is
 * whole, and there is nothing to complain about. Asserting that a window always
 * exists would be asserting that every park is the same park, which is the
 * opposite of what the generator is for.
 *
 * Proven to have teeth rather than assumed to: shrinking the opening below the
 * car's width, cutting it 3 m from where the route crosses, shoving it into a
 * corner tower and raising it through the battlements each turn this red — and
 * building the wall solid while still declaring the openings is what exposed
 * that the swept check was measuring nothing at all, because a headless park
 * never renders and every `matrixWorld` was still the identity.
