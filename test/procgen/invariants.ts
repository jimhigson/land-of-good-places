 * **The rail-race stall stands at the park's rim, close to the actual rails**
 * — the family's 1 August 2026 ask, and the property two earlier attempts (PR
 * #159, then this move) found hardest to hold onto. Moving the booth out
 * turned out to be easy to break in ways that only show up on a *different*
 * seed than the one somebody happened to test: `parkManifest.ts`'s note on
 * this pin records a wall landing across a completely unrelated waypoint's
 * line of sight, a knock-on effect of the scenery generator's single shared
 * RNG stream noticing the spur got longer. That failure mode is exactly what
 * running across several seeds is for.
 *
 * "Close to the rails" is proved **relationally** rather than against an
 * invented distance, per this file's own rule that thresholds should come
 * from the game: the booth's gap to the built ring must be the *smallest of
 * every plot in the park* — every anchor and every other stall. That is a
 * strong claim (checked against the old, inland pin: the ferris wheel's own
 * plot was closer to the rim, so this would have failed), and it stays true
 * without a metre figure that would go stale the moment the ring or the
 * park's own radius is retuned, on whatever this seed happens to place
 * everything else at.
 *
 * The doormat is also proved standable and, separately, reachable from the
 * park entrance on the real nav lattice — the exact two properties the
 * `paths.ts` spur `past`-extension bug and the scenery RNG-cascade wall broke
 * on the positions this move swept through before landing here. Standability
 * is already covered generically for every entrance by `entrancesAreUsable`;
