 *
 * 1. **Measure the built park, never the rules that built it.** `ParkFacts`
 *    reads everything back off a real `World`. An invariant that re-derives a
 *    placement rule and checks the placement agrees with it has proved
 *    nothing — see the header of `parkFacts.ts`.
 * 2. **Thresholds come from the game, not from the generator.** Prefer
 *    `PLAYER_RADIUS`, `TRACK_CLEARANCE`, `SHORTFALL_TOLERANCE` — numbers that
 *    already mean something — over the constant the generator happens to aim
 *    for. Asserting the generator's own target only proves it can do
 *    arithmetic, and it turns every future tuning change into a test failure.
