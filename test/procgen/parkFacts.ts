 * **A built park, reduced to the facts an invariant can be stated about.**

 * on: *a number an author writes down is a claim; a number derived from the
 * built object is a fact*. Nothing here describes what the generators are
 * supposed to do. Every field below is read back off a real `World` — the wall
 * runs `Scenery` actually stood up, the trees it actually planted, the curve
 * the train actually solved — so an invariant that passes has been proved
 * against the park, not against the rules that were meant to produce it.
 *
 * It complements `check:park` rather than replacing it. That script owns the
 * six invariants about whether the park *works* — routing, the waypoint graph,
 * rail exclusion — and holds them to a ratchet on one canonical seed. This
 * suite owns the invariants about whether the park's scattered furniture is
 * *placed sanely*, and holds them across many seeds with no allowances at all.
